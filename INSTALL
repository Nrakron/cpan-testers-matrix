PREREQUISITES
-------------

Install the prerequisites as listed in Makefile.PL.

The perl minimum version is probably 5.6.0, but see below.

CGI
---

You need to make cgi-bin/cpantestermatrix.pl available as a CGI script.

PLACK
-----

Alternatively: one very easy way of doing that is using the included
cpan-testers-matrix.psgi file that wraps up the CGI script in a PSGI
application. Just make sure the following modules are installed:

- Plack
- CGI::Emulate::PSGI
- CGI::Compile

Then point `plackup' or your favourite PSGI-supporting webserver at
it, e.g.:

  $ plackup cpan-testers-matrix.psgi
  HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

Note that you might need to change the #! shebang in
cgi-bin/cpantestermatrix.pl if you want to run it with a perl other
than /usr/bin/perl.

APACHE
------

With apache + mod_perl you can use the nearly "zero conf"
configuration file etc/httpd.conf:

* Just include the configuration file for use into your Apache, e.g.
  on a FreeBSD system:

    cd /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes
    ln -s /path/to/cpan-testers-matrix/etc/httpd.conf cpan-testers-matrix.conf

  Or on a Debian system (make sure the libapache2-mod-perl2 is installed)

    cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
    ln -s /path/to/cpan-testers-matrix/etc/httpd.conf cpan-testers-matrix.conf

* NameVirtualHost should be turned on in the standard Apache
  configuration, if not already done, e.g. add into the standard
  httpd.conf:

    NameVirtualHost *:80

* Add an entry with the hostname "matrix-cpantesters" to your local
  DNS, or, easier, to your /etc/hosts:

    127.0.0.1     matrix-cpantesters

* Restart the Apache, and point your browser to http://matrix-cpantesters

* Make sure that a cache file may be written by the Apache user. On a
  Debian system:

    touch -t 197001010000 cgi-bin/cpantesters_amendments.st
    sudo chown www-data cgi-bin/cpantesters_amendments.st


PROBLEMS
--------

It's recommended to use perl 5.14.0 or later because of slowness when
using taint mode. See
https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75954 This is
really only needed when viewing large author pages (e.g. ADAMK,
ZOFFIX). Another fix is to just remove "-T" from the
cgi-bin/cpantestermatrix.pl shebang.
